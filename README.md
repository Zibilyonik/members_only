# Private Events

This project is a simple platform to allow users to sign in, create events and attend events as they desire. It is created as a practice on RESTful MVC, Authentication process , and a many-to-many Association for the first time.

## Built With

* Ruby version: 2.6.6

* Rails 6.0.3

* HTML / CSS / Sass

## Getting Started
You will need Ruby ver. 2.6.6 installed on your system, which you can do so by visiting https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ and following the directions from there depending on your system.

Once you have the correct version of Ruby, you can clone this repository by calling `git clone git@github.com:Zibilyonik/members_only.git` command from your terminal.

After that, make sure that you use `bundle:install` command to install all the required gems.

For the next step, you need to set up the database, by using the commands `rails db:create` and `rails db:migrate`.

Afterwards, you can run `rails s` command to start up the server and use it as you will.

To access the running server, you can visit localhost:3000 or 127.0.0.1:3000 (the default port, may change if you've used a different setting)


## Running the Tests

To run the tests, you need to make sure that you have all the required gems installed, especially RSpec. Once you have RSpec installed, you can run all the tests by the `rspec` command, or a specific test by the `rspec [test_path]` command through the terminal.
